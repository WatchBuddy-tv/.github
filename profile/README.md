## 🔌 Developer Ecosystem: ExampleProvider

WatchBuddy is built on a **decentralized and extensible** architecture. You are not limited to pre-defined content; you can create your own content providers and integrate them into the WatchBuddy ecosystem effortlessly.

The [ExampleProvider](https://github.com/WatchBuddy-tv/ExampleProvider) project serves as the official blueprint for developers:

- **Plug & Play:** Simply add your provider URL to the WatchBuddy app to start watching.
- **Isolated Development:** Build and test your scrapers in a local environment without any dependencies.
- **Powered by [KekikStream](https://github.com/keyiflerolsun/KekikStream):** Utilize modern link extraction tools to resolve media URLs. Based on the architecture of [KekikStreamAPI](https://github.com/keyiflerolsun/KekikStreamAPI).

> 🚀 **Build Your Own:** Use the `ExampleProvider` template to bridge your favorite websites into the WatchBuddy experience with minimal Python code.
